    <p><em>Consultant and Entrepreneur</em></p>
    <p>I was born in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, NY
      at the height of the baby boom in 1955. My parents were the children of immigrants from the Jewish Pale of Settlement in Eastern Europe,
      with the exception of my maternal grandfather Abraham, who was born in Baltimore and had the distinction according to his wife, my
      grandmother Florence, of being <em>a real American.</em>
      <br />
    <p>The Brookln I grew up in was in transition from protective, Jewish ghetto, to neighborhood being exploited by block breaking landlords, increasing levels of crime probably attributable to increasing levels of drug abuse and addiction among 14-25
      year olds.
